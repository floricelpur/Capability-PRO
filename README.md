A comprehensive, professional-grade web-based tool for analyzing and assessing process capabilities in manufacturing and quality engineering. **Capability PRO** enables engineers and quality professionals to evaluate process performance against specification limits and determine process capability indices (Cpk, Pp, Ppk, etc.) with ease.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Process Capability Analysis**: Calculate comprehensive capability metrics including Cp, Cpk, Pp, Ppk, Cpu, Cpl, and K (process shift)
- **Multiple Specification Types**: Support for bilateral specifications (LSL & USL), unilateral lower limit (LSL only), and unilateral upper limit (USL only)
- **Professional Visualization**: Interactive histograms with normal distribution curves (Minitab-style) for intuitive process assessment
- **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive statistics including means, standard deviations (overall and within-group), and process centering metrics
- **Smart Parameter Adjustment**: Automatic parameter optimization to achieve target capability indices
- **Multi-Language Support**: Available in English and Romanian for global accessibility
- **Export Capabilities**: Easy export to CSV format for further analysis in Excel, Minitab, or other quality tools
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **No Installation Required**: Runs entirely in the browser with no software installation needed
- **Fullscreen Visualization**: Enhanced viewing mode for detailed histogram analysis

## 📋 What You Can Analyze

With Capability PRO, analyze:
- **Process centering and variation** relative to specification limits
- **Capability to meet specifications** under current process conditions
- **Short-term vs. long-term performance** using within-group and overall standard deviations
- **Specification limit shifts** and their impact on capability indices
- **Process improvement targets** needed to achieve desired Cpk levels

## 🎯 Target Users

- **Quality Engineers** and QA professionals
- **Manufacturing Engineers** and Plant Managers
- **Process Improvement Specialists** and Lean Six Sigma practitioners
- **Academic Researchers** in quality control and statistics
- **Organizations** implementing ISO 9001, AS9100, and other quality standards

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Select your specification type:
   - **Bilateral**: Use when both lower and upper specification limits apply
   - **Unilateral LSL**: Use when only a minimum value is required
   - **Unilateral USL**: Use when only a maximum value is required
3. Enter your specification limits (LSL/USL)
4. Set your target Cpk value (default: 1.67 for most industrial applications)
5. Configure sample size and analysis parameters
6. Click "Analyze" to generate comprehensive process capability report
7. Review statistics, visualizations, and recommendations

## 🔧 Advanced Options

- **Custom Tolerance Levels**: Adjust the margin for achieving target Cpk
- **Subgroup Analysis**: Evaluate process variation within and between subgroups
- **Range Restrictions**: Define operational constraints for data range
- **Parameter Auto-Adjustment**: Enable intelligent parameter tuning for optimization
- **Decimal Precision**: Control output precision for different applications

## 📊 Capability Indices Explained

- **Cp**: Process capability potential (if perfectly centered)
- **Cpk**: Process capability considering centering (actual performance)
- **Pp**: Process performance potential (long-term)
- **Ppk**: Process performance considering centering (long-term)
- **Cpu/Cpl**: Capability relative to upper or lower specification limits
- **K**: Process shift indicator showing how far mean is from target

## 🔒 Data Privacy

Capability PRO processes all data locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers. Your analysis remains completely private and confidential.

## 💻 Technical Requirements

- **Browser**: Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, or compatible)
- **Internet**: Required only for initial page load (CDN resources)
- **JavaScript**: Must be enabled in browser settings
- **No Installation**: Runs directly in browser - zero setup required
